# Intro to ML Safety course notes

This repository contains notes for the [Intro to ML Safety](https://course.mlsafety.org/) course.

Currently, the notes are not yet complete. We are looking for volunteers who will help us finish them. Ideally, notes will present the information from lectures and readings in a different way, so that students can have multiple angles of looking at the same material.

Some prelimary notes on some of the topics already exist, but they aren't complete:
- [Adversarial Robustness](/Adversarial%20Examples)
- [Interpretable Uncertainty](/Interpretable%20Uncertainty)
- [Black Swan Robustness](/Distribution%20Shift%20Robustness)
- [Anomaly Detection](/Anomaly%20Detection)
